# ── Task B ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The scaffold ships with a working generate_event_flyer that has two paths:
#
#   - Live mode: if FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL is set in .env, the tool calls that
#     model and returns a real image URL.
#   - Placeholder mode: otherwise (the default) the tool returns a
#     deterministic placehold.co URL with mode="placeholder".
#
# Both paths return success=True. Both count as "implemented" for grading.
# This is not the original Task B — the original asked you to write a direct
# FLUX image call, but Nebius removed FLUX on 2026-04-13. See CHANGELOG.md
# §Changed for why we pivoted the task.

# Did your run of the flyer tool produce a success=True result?
# (This will be True for both live and placeholder mode — both are valid.)
TASK_B_IMPLEMENTED = True   # True or False

# Which path did your run take? "live" or "placeholder"

# If you didn't set FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL in .env, you will get "placeholder".

TASK_B_WHY_AGENT_SURVIVED = """
Because the tool caught the failure internally and returned success response. This makes sense as exceptions break agent loops so we kinda should avoid them. We should keep the agent's flow intact regardless of what's happening on the api side.

SCENARIO_1_PIVOT_MOMENT = """
After calling check_pub_availability tool that returned the Bow Bar with status full, the agent called the tool another time, as the first pub was full. The meets_all_constraints: false led to the second tool call basically, triggering the pivot.

SCENARIO_2_FINAL_ANSWER = """
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants a venue for 300 people with vegan options. The known venues are The Albanach, The Haymarket Vaults, The Guilford Arms, and The Bow Bar. I checked each one using the check_pub_availability function.

The Albanach has a capacity of 180, which is under 300. Haymarket Vaults is 160, also too small. Guilford Arms has 200 capacity but no vegan options. Bow Bar has 80 capacity and vegan, but it's full. None of them meet both the capacity and availability. So I need to tell the user that none of the known venues can handle their request. Maybe suggest looking for other options outside the known list or adjusting the requirements.
</think>

None of the known Edinburgh venues can accommodate 300 guests with vegan options. The maximum capacity among the checked venues is 200 (The Guilford Arms), but it lacks vegan options. The largest venue with vegan options (The Albanach) only holds 180 people. You may need to consider alternative venues outside this list or adjust your requirements.

# Scenario 3: out of scope (train times)

SCENARIO_3_RESPONSE = """
<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the last train time from Edinburgh Waverley to London tonight. Let me check the tools provided.

Looking at the available functions: check_pub_availability, get_edinburgh_weather, calculate_catering_cost, generate_event_flyer. None of these are related to train schedules. The functions are for checking pub availability, weather, catering costs, and generating flyers.

Since there's no tool for train times, I can't use any of the provided functions to answer this. I need to inform the user that I don't have access to that information and suggest they check a train service website or app.
</think>

I don't have access to real-time train schedules or transportation data. For the most accurate information about the last train from Edinburgh Waverley to London, I recommend checking:
1. The National Rail website (https://www.nationalrail.co.uk)
2. Train service apps like Citymapper or Trainline
3. The specific train operator's website (e.g., LNER)

Would you like help with anything related to Edinburgh pubs, weather, or event planning instead?"

SCENARIO_3_ACCEPTABLE = """
Yes, this is acceptable. It's better if it admits it can't do something instead of hallucinating in an attempt to please, i.e. suggesting random departure times etc. Unnecessary creativity here will bring more harm than good. So yes, this is acceptable.

MOST_SURPRISING = """
What was quite surprising to me is that in the Task A the agent was prompted to check the weather 'for outdoor drinks suitability', the weather tool outdoor_ok: false. The flyer prompt wasn't mentioning indoor/outdoor options and the agent just disregarded the weather info. It performed the tool call because it was instructed and just discarded the data. This highlights the importance of including more info about the intent to help the agent reason and make the right judgement, I guess
